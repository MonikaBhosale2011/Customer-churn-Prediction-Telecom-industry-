# Customer-churn-Prediction-Telecom-industry-
## Tools Used- Python, Machine Learning

#### The project predict customer churn based on customer attributes.The main objective of the project was to build a predictive model to generate a prioritized list of customers most vulnerable to churn.
#### Implemented following classification models and optimize the same using Hyperparameter Tuning and 5 fold cross validation.Logistic classifier, Random forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier, K nearest neighbor classifier, Naive Bayes classifier.

## Problem Statement: 
1. Perform Basic EDA 
a. Boxplot 
b. Histogram – Distribution of Target Variable 
c. Distribution Plot – Target Variable 
d. Aggregation for all numerical Columns 
e. Unique Values across all columns 
f. Duplicate values across all columns 
g. Correlation – Heatmap 
h. Regression Plot 
i. Bar Plot 
j. Pair plot 
P.s: All the above charts should be plotted against every independent variable vs Target 
Variable. (Except b and c) 
2. Drop all duplicate rows 
3. Drop all non-essential features 
4. Replace outliers with Nulls (if you find it essential) and replace all the nulls with respective 
approach of central tendencies (Mean/Median/Mode). 
5. Calculate Z score to validate whether outliers are still present or not. 
6. Clean the data with formatting issues if any. (converting datatypes, replacing dollars, etc.) 
7. Add your view of EDA to enhance understanding of data. i.e., Grouping data and observing 
the way data is distributed. Try to add as many layers of EDA as possible. 
8. Build a model of choice – Classification problem statement, hence build a classification 
model first and calculate Confusion Matrix, AUC, F1 Score, Precision, Recall and Accuracy. 
9. Build at least a minimum of 4 different Regression models. All the models should use K-Fold 
cross Validation to train the model with at least 5-fold cross validation. 
10. Compare the error and pick the ideal one with least errors. 
11. Run hyperparameter tuning on all the models and pick the best parameters (A minimum of 2 
Parameters should be tuned) and picked. 
12. Now, compare the models and pick the ideal one. 
13. Try to Predict the target with maximum independent features. 
14. Write the insights and your findings (in PPT). 
15. Plot all independent variable against Target Variable in Tableau (Once the data is cleaned) 
and build a Dashboard and Story out of it.
